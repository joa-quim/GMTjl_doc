- **L** or **map\_scale** : -- *map\_scale=([map=true, inside=true, norm=true, paper=true,] anchor=refpoint, scale\_at\_lat=lat, length=len [,align=side, justify=code, fancy=true, label=lab, offset=(dx,dy), units=unit, vertical=true])*\
   Draws a simple map scale centered on the reference point specified using one of four coordinate systems: (1) Use **map=true** for map (user) coordinates, (2) use **inner=code** for setting **refpoint** via a 2-char justification code that refers to the (invisible) map domain rectangle, (3) use **norm=true** for normalized (0-1) coordinates, or (4) use **paper=true** for plot coordinates (inches, cm, etc.). Scale is calculated for latitude **slat** (optionally supply longitude **slon** for oblique projections [Default is central meridian]), **length=len** when **len** is in km, or append unit from **e** or **f** or **k** or **M** ot **n** or **u**. Change the label alignment with **align=:left|:right|:top|:bottom**. Use **fancy=true** to get a "fancy" scale [Default is plain]. By default, the anchor point on the map scale is assumed to be the center of the scale (MC), but this can be changed by adding **justify=code**, where **code** is a 2-char justification code (see \myreflink{text} for list and explanation of codes). **label=lab** selects the default label, which equals the distance unit (meter, foot, km, mile, nautical mile, US survey foot) and is justified on top of the scale. Change this by giving your own label **lab**. Add **offset=(dx,dy)** to offset the map scale by **dx,dy** away from the **anchor** in the direction implied by **justify**. Select **units=unit** to append the unit to all distance annotations along the scale (for the plain scale, this will instead select the unit to be appended to the distance length). Cartesian projections: Origin **scale\_at\_lat** is not required, **fancy** is not allowed, and no units should be specified in **length**. You must set any Cartesian data units via **label**. For a vertical rather than horizontal Cartesian scale, append **vertical=true**. Note: Use [FONT\_LABEL] to change the label font and [FONT\_ANNOT\_PRIMARY] to change the annotation font. The height of the map scale is controlled by [MAP\_SCALE\_HEIGHT], and the pen thickness is set by [MAP\_TICK\_PEN\_PRIMARY]. See **box** on how to place a panel behind the scale.
