# Filled curves

The GMT *plot* module has a huge number of options. The *polygon* (-L in original) option in itself
is what other packages call `band`, so we wrapped another avatar around it and with that name too.

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
x = -10:0.11:10;
band(x, sin.(x)./x, width=0.1, fill="green@80", show=true)
```
\end{examplefig}

We could have obtained the same plot using a function as argument.

```julia
band(x->sin(x)/x, 10, width=0.1, fill="green@80", show=true)
```

Next example hides the line and plots only the bands. Since when we ask for a color fill the lines is always
plotted, the trick to no see it is to assign it full transparency. We use also a theme to change the default
tick orientation and add automatic grid lines.

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
x = -10:0.1:10;
band(x, sin.(x), region=(-10,10,-1.5,1.5), width=0.3, pen=(0,"blue@100"),
     fill="blue@80", theme=("A2atgIT"))
band!(x, cos.(x), width=0.3, pen=(0,"red@100"), fill="red@80", show=true)
```
\end{examplefig}

And another example where the band is asymetric and grows in width. We had to add `eps()` to first `x`
to not have a NaN in first element of `y`.

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
x = 0+eps():0.05:4Ï€
y =  sin.(3x) ./ (cos.(x) .+ 2)./x
band([x y], y .- 0.1 .- 0.015x, y .+ 0.1 .+ 0.03x, fill="blue@80", show=true)
```
\end{examplefig}
