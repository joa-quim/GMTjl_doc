# Earth tides

Dis you know that it's not only the ocens that have a tide? Yes, the solid
Earth has tides as well, and they are not so small as one might imagine.

## A global view

This example shows a global view of the vertical component of the Earth tide
for a perticular data.

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
G = earthtide(T="2022-07-07T12:00:00");
imshow(G, coast=true, colorbar=true, title="Earth tide at noon 7-July-2022")
```
\end{examplefig}

##  The 3 components

Now we show the three components of the Earth tide for a specific location (the Panama Cannal)
and time interval (the 7'th July 2022).

First we compute the components that will come out in a \myreflink{GMTdataset} with
named columns. This is handy because we can refer to them by name instead of by column number.

```julia:./code/ex1
using GMT, PrettyTables   # hide
getpath4docs(file::String) = joinpath("..", "..", "..", "..", "..", file) # hide
io = IOBuffer() # hide
D = earthtide(range="2022-07-07T/2022-07-08T/1m", location=(-82,9))
pretty_table(io, D.data[1:5,:]; header=D.colnames, backend=Val(:html))	# hide
println("~~~" * String(take!(io)) * "~~~") # hide
```
\textoutput{./code/ex1}

Now plot the three of them with a legend

\begin{examplefig}{}
```julia
using GMT
D = earthtide(range="2022-07-07T/2022-07-08T/1m", location=(-82,9));	# hide
plot(D[:Time, :Vertical], lc=:red, lw=1, legend=:Vertical,
     title="Earth tide components (m) at Panama Cannal")
plot!(D[:Time, :East],  lc=:green, lw=1, legend=:East)
plot!(D[:Time, :North], lc=:blue,  lw=1, legend=:North, show=1)
```
\end{examplefig}
