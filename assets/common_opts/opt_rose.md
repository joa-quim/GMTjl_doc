- **Td** or **rose** : -- *rose=([map=true, inside=true, outside=true, norm=true, paper=true,] anchor=refpoint, width=width [,justify=code, fancy=level, labels=labels, offset=(dx,dy)])*\
   Draws a map directional rose on the map at the location defined by the reference and anchor points: Give the reference point on the map for the rose using one of four coordinate systems: (1) Use **map=true** for map (user) coordinates, (2) use ``inside=code`` for setting **refpoint** via a 2-char justification code that refers to the (invisible) map domain rectangle, (3) use **norm=true** for normalized (0-1) coordinates, or (4) use **paper=true** for plot coordinates (inches, cm, etc.). You can offset the reference point with **offset=(dx,dy)** in the direction implied by **justify=code**. By default, the anchor point is assumed to be the center of the rose (MC), but this can be changed by using **justify=code** where **code** is a 2-char justification code (see `text` for list and explanation of codes). Note: If **outside=true** is used then **justify** defaults to the same as **refpoint**, if **outside=true** is used then **justify** defaults to the mirror opposite of **refpoint**. Use **width=width** to set the width of the rose in plot coordinates (in inches, cm, or points). Add **fancy=true** to get a "fancy" rose, and specify in **level** what you want drawn. The default [1 or *true*] draws the two principal E-W, N-S orientations, 2 adds the two intermediate NW-SE and NE-SW orientations, while 3 adds the eight minor orientations WNW-ESE, NNW-SSE, NNE-SSW, and ENE-WSW. Label the cardinal points W,E,S,N by adding **labels** and append your own four comma-separated string to override the default. Skip a specific label by leaving it blank. See `Placing-dir-map-roses` and **box** on how to place a panel behind the scale.
